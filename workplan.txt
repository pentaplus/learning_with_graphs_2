* Forschungsprojekt

** Tasks
  [] Selection and crafting of datasets
        [] Malware FCG/CFG/IPCFG (Android, x86)
        [] Source code PDGs
        [x] Chemistry
        [] Others
  [] Analysis and discussion of graph properties

** Goals
   - Get to know useful libraries and tools:
        - numpy
        - scipy
        - matplotlib
        - ipython
        - networkx
        - scikit-learn (to be used later)
        
   - Study the topological properties of the graphs datasets
   to help designing expressive feature spaces.
